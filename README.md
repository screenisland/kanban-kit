##News:

###What's planned for the next update?
The next version will be focussed on Keyboard only usage.
I want to implement selecting and opening tasks via keyboard navigation (arrow keys and enter).
The whole Application should be usable keyboard only for quick navigation and moving tasks etc.

###February 2015:
Version 1.0.3 is out.
It features UI refinements, speed improvements, slight keyboard improvements, and a "Mark as Blocked" Feature.
If you have boards with lots of Tasks the Task Header (Todo, Next, In Progress, Done) always stays visible.


###July 2014:
Version 1.0.2 is on it's way and will be available in the App Store within the next days.
Changelog:
- Renaming to Kanban Kit
- Completion of Subtasks are now visualized on the overview board
- UI Refinements

###June 2014: 
Version 1.0.1 is on it's way and will be available in the App Store within the next days.
Changelog: 
- Performance Improvements
- Smaller App Size (less than 2MB)
